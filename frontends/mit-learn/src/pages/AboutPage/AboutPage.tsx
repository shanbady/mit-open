          Since its founding in 1861, MIT has been committed to sharing
          knowledge with the world. At the beginning of the 21st century, MIT
          expanded this mission by bringing learning resources online, reaching
          a broader audience through digital platforms. Today, MIT continues to
          advance this mission by offering non-degree learning resources,
          including online, in-person, and blended courses and programs. These
          opportunities allow learners to study with MIT faculty, industry
          experts, and a global community without enrolling in a degree program.
          Through these resources, millions of learners have acquired the
          knowledge and skills needed to further their academic and professional
          goals.
